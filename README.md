# Journal-7.Topic-About-the-project-as-a-team-work.
This is all about how we went through the group project work at the end of the course.
As we got the project for this course to do as a team and we had to connect together on git hub.We were not knowing how to connect together and upload or works there so that everyone can edit and view the writings.But later on after deciding the topic.We did mistakes and explored much more about the functioning features of the git hub that we can make it public, add the contributors, anyone can comment on the writings, schedule the project works and also can divide the bigger project into smaller chunks as  we had done as to do, in progress and done.We got to know multiple features about github through doing this project,”How do credit card transactions work?”.I can conclude a new version of word docs with more features and is very new to me.
